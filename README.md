## How to Use üöÄ

There are three easy ways to load a quiz.

### 1. Paste XML Content

1.  Open your Moodle XML quiz file in a text editor.
2.  Copy the entire content.
3.  Navigate to the Quiz Viewer page.
4.  Paste the content into the text area under "Or Paste XML Content."
5.  Click **Start Quiz**.

### 2. Load from URL

1.  Make sure your Moodle XML file is hosted at a publicly accessible URL.
    * *Note: Due to browser security (CORS), this may not work for all URLs. Using a service like GitHub Gist is recommended.*
2.  Paste the URL into the "Load from URL" input field.
3.  Click **Start Quiz**.

### 3. Load via URL Parameter

You can create a direct link to a quiz by appending its URL as a query parameter. This is the best way to share a specific quiz with others.

**Format:**
`https://<your-username>.github.io/<repository-name>/?url=<URL_TO_YOUR_XML_FILE>`

**Example:**
`https://your-name.github.io/moodle-quiz-viewer/?url=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/user/quiz.xml`

## Security üõ°Ô∏è

This application is designed with security as a priority. User-provided content from an XML file can contain malicious scripts (an attack known as Cross-Site Scripting or XSS).

To prevent this, all content drawn from the XML file (`<questiontext>`, `<answer>`, `<feedback>`, etc.) is sanitized using the **DOMPurify** library before it is rendered on the page. This process removes any potentially harmful code, such as `<script>` tags and `onerror` attributes, while preserving safe HTML formatting (like bold, italics, and lists). You can safely load XML files from any source.

## Supported Question Types

This viewer has full or partial support for the following Moodle XML question types:

* ‚úÖ `multichoice`
* ‚úÖ `truefalse`
* ‚úÖ `shortanswer`
* ‚úÖ `numerical`
* ‚úÖ `matching`
* ‚úÖ `essay`
* ‚úÖ `cloze` (Embedded Answers)
* ‚úÖ `description`
* ‚úÖ `category`

Any other question types (`ordering`, `gapselect`, etc.) will be gracefully skipped with a message informing the user that the type is not supported, allowing the rest of the quiz to proceed without error.
